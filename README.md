# Welcome
Hey ðŸ˜€ and welcome to my perl repository.
<br>
Here you can find various Perl scripts that I created
<br><br>
Every now and then I dabble in Perl. It's not my favorite programming language, but I still find the language interesting. And that's why it might happen that I get to work with Perl again
<br><br><br>
<b>I would like to make one thing very clear at this point:</b><br>
If you find a Perl script here that looks interesting to you (and/or you like the code), and therefore you decide to use the code, <strong>then you do so entirely at your own risk</strong>. I assume no responsibility for any problems/damage that may arise from using my code.
